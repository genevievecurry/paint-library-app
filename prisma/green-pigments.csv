Whilst nearly all shades of the known mineral colors can be imitated by means of coal-tar colors, none of the green lakes obtained from organic coloring matters is bright enough to bear comparison with emerald green. Unfortunately, however, emerald green, on account of its high content of arsenic, is one of the most poisonous colors known, if not the most poisonous of all.""
