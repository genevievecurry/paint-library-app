 Genuine Van Dyke Brown is NBr8. Sennelier's Van Dyck Brown dry pigment, Utrecht's Van Dyke Brown oil paint and Schminke's Cassel Earth oil color all indicate they are PBr8, which is a more stable pigment but not the genuine Van Dyke Brown.
 The Color Index (Third Edition 1997) lists Van Dyke Brown or Cassel Earth as Natural Brown 8 (NBr8), and lists Pigment Brown 8 (PBr8) as Manganese hydroxide and oxides (the natural form usually also contains iron oxides and clays). 
 This seems to be a common point of confusion even among pigment and paint manufacturers. see PBr8
 * Not rated by the AMST, usually though of as fugitive, but some old paintings have survived in fairly good shape, though it can cause sagging in oil paints. Kremer's BWS seems to indicate excellent lightfastness.

 According to their web site Williamsburg's Van Dyke Brown is PBr9. This might be a typo. In the copy they claim it to be genuine Van Dyke Brown which would be NBr8, although the Colour Index (3rd. Ed. 1997) describes the first known use as being called Vandyke Brown. 
 However ""Van Dyke Red"" is indicated to be Copper Ferrocyanide in A Treatise on Color Manufacture By George Zerr, Robert Rübencamp, 1908, and said to be a ""shade that can be imitated cheaply and very easily with red ferric oxide colours"" indicating a brownish nature. So it seems there might be a historical justification for labeling PBr9 as genuine Van Dyke Brown in paints, even though it is not the pigment generally thought to be the ""genuine"" Van Dyke brown."
