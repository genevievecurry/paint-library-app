 Natural (Green Emitting) pigment;
 The first ""glow in the dark"" or phosphorescent pigment. Consists of fine crystals of Zinc sulfide. Copper is added to the zinc sulfide as an activator, referred to as copper doping. This allows the crystals to absorb light and slowly emit it over time. The slow emission is called phosphorescence. This material has a light yellow (natural) body color and a yellowish green afterglow. (Ref: Raw Materials Supply);",light yellow body color with bright yellowish green afterglow,S/O,X,,"Raw pigment has a strong sulfuric odor, but it is usually masked when mixed into the medium.

 Vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays or VANTAs are a unique microstructure consisting of carbon nanotubes oriented along their longitudinal axes normal to a substrate surface. These VANTAs effectively preserve and often accentuate the unique anisotropic properties of individual carbon nanotubes and possess a morphology that may be precisely controlled. VANTAs are consequently widely useful in a range of current and potential device applications.[1]",Deep black,O,I,A,"Claimed to be World’s darkest manmade substance.
