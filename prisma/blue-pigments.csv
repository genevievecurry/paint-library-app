 Synthetic ultramarine is made by mixing anhydrous sodium sulfate or sodium carbonate with charcoal, clay, rosin, silica, sulfur, and slowly calcined in a reducing atmosphere to 1,380º F (750º C). The various shades of blues, greens, reds and violets are produced by varying heating times and temperatures, mixture proportions, and/or other modifiers. For example Ultramarine Green is the ""first product of ignition in the manufacture of Ultramarine blue by the indirect process (Ref Color Index 3rd Ed., V.4, Inorganic colorants CI 77013). Synthetic ultramarine blue has particles that rounder, finer and more even in size than the natural ultramarine. (Ref at Boston Fine Arts CAMEO Materials Database);

 * Although Lapis Lazuli (after purifying) and Ultramarine Blue are essentially the same chemically, Lapis Lazuli is the natural mineral source and has different working properties, it also contains iron pyrite crystals that can give it a slight 'sparkle'. Lapis Lazuli is also a much more expensive pigment so it is misleading to label Synthetic PB29 as Lapis Lazuli.

 Oxides of Cobalt and Tin;
 Originally composed of cobalt stannate. Cerulean blue is made by roasting cobalt and tin oxides. Cerulean blue (Ref at Boston Fine Arts CAMEO Art Materials Database); 
  
 Cobalt Tin Grey Co2SnO4 is an inorganic pigment that is the reaction product of calcining a mixture of different amounts of both cobalt (II) oxide and tin (III) oxide. They are homogeneously, ionically entwined forming a crystalline spinel type matrix. The constitution may additionally have Al2O3, Fe2O3, and/or NiO as modifiers that are used to adjust color hue and other properties that may be needed in specific applications.  (Ref IPConsortium);

 ""Cobalt chromate is used for it's excellent permanency and fastness to weather"" (Reference: Coatings Technology handbook, Third Edition, Edited by Arthur A. Tracton, 2006 by CRC Press);
 * PB 36 (Cobalt Chromite Blue-Green Spinel) is often substituted for the historically genuine Cerulean Blue (PB35, Cobalt Stannate) by Colormen, in some cases even claiming it to be ""genuine"", however C.I. Pigment Blue 36 is not the traditional pigment named Cerulean Blue PB-35.; 
 C. I. Pigment Blue 36 (Cobalt Chromite) is usually greener, and brighter than C. I. Pigment Blue 35, with a higher tinting strength. 
 PB36 (Cobalt Chromite) is said to be a lower cost pigment to manufacture (due it's lower cobalt content). Additionally it's higher tinting strength may also tempt some manufacturers to dilute it with adulterants. 
 PB36 is a nice color in it's own right, but the cheaper pigment cost should be reflected in the price of any paint made from PB36 and called ""Cerulean Blue"", unfortunately, it is often priced similar to the genuine Cerulean Blue (PB35) which is a costly pigment. 
 ** All Cobalt paints require a PROP 65 label in CA.
 This pigment is not very soluble in water or solvents, so it stands to reason, that real world risks are quite low for this pigment, even though it contains cobalt. One form called ""Blue 10F545"" by Shepherd Color Company has even been approved by the FDA for indirect food contact. (Reference @ shepherdcolor.com);
