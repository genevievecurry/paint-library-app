*?According to the MSDS Sheet, Utrecht Artists' Watercolor Paint ""Cadmium Yellow Light Pure"" is PY37. There is a typo on the website indicating it is PBk9, which can not be, because PBk9 is Pigment Black 9 or ""Bone Black""
* Requires a PROP 65 label in California.
Avoid dust & spray, do not ingest, do not heat.
According to the ECHA, no hazards have been classified for Cadmium yellow: (Ref. ECHA European Chemical Agency) Note: Cadmium pigments are nearly insoluble in water, limiting their potential toxicity. They are carefully engineered to meet extremely low solubility limits.
""A risk assessment of these products conducted by the EU concluded that these products offer no significant hazard to either human health or to the environment.""
(Ref. Cadmium.org). Older paints made before 1980 may have less stringent standards.
Soluble Cadmium compounds can be toxic if ingested or if the dust is inhaled, they are a known reproductive and developmental toxicants.

In 'The chemistry of paints and painting' by Arthur Church, he states:
""Aureolin properly prepared in oil does not fade by exposure to sunlight, nor does it darken, except so far as the admixed oil is concerned. As a water-colour aureolin is practically permanent, even in sunlight, as the following figures show:""

 ?* Magnesium Euxanthate is thought to be the main yellow coloring chemical of genuine natural Indian yellow. It is possible (ed. Probable) the urine of cow history of Indian Yellow is nothing more than an myth (see my blog article) and true Indian Yellow is simply euxanthate acid, isolated from a natural source, and precipitaded on a dolomite or other base cantaining magnesium., possibly from a plant source and mixed with magnesia or precipitated on a calcium base. The chemical formula for Vat Yellow 20 contains no Magnesium, the pigment is the Vat Yellow dye preciptated on a base, most likely Calcium carbonate or Magnesium hydroxide.

 ""The sources of yellow lake are numerous, but the best kind is obtained from quercitron bark from Quercus tinctoria, Qu. nigra, and Qu. citrina, three species of North American oak.""
 ""Yellow lake was formerly made from the fruits of various species of buckthorn, known as Persian, Turkish, or Avignon berries.""
 "" 'Stil de grain,' and several of the continental yellow lakes, are made from the above-named berry""
 ""Italian pink, Dutch pink, and deep yellow madder are names usually given to the richer yellow lakes of quercitron, although some of these pigments are occasionally prepared from Turkish or Avignon berries.""

 Generally, the colorant was absorbed on clay, chalk or alumina trihydrate to form the lake, mixed with alum and precipitated with an alkali (sodium carbonate) (Ref: pigments-historiques.blogspot, here is an english translation)
  
 After 1819, it was also extracted from the black or dark brown bark of the black oak, Quercus velutina (formerly Quercus nigra) with Quercitron as the main coloring component; (Ref: Dutch Pink, CAMEO Materials Database MFA, Boston); (Ref: Quercitron, CAMEO Materials Database MFA, Boston);

 † Hue shift towards brown; Fades",T,IV,A,"* there is inconsistent and confusing literature and information on NY13 and NY14. Many sources seem to use both interchangeably.
 It appears that most often what is called Natural Yellow 14 (NY14), is what was originally called ""still de grain"" made from Buckthorn Berries (Rhamnus catharticus).
 But, later, after appox. 1819, the pigment extracted from Black Oak was called ""still de grain"".
 As far as I can determine, It seems Natural Yellow 13 (NY13), most often refers to that made with Black Oak and Quercitron as the main coloring matter. (Ref: Dutch Pink, CAMEO Materials Database MFA, Boston);
 (Ref: Color Index Constitution Numbers Third Ed, 1998, numbers 75430, 75640; 75650; 75660, 75695; 75700; 75710;), 
  
 ** Pink in this sense refers to a yellow pigment based on natural yellow dyes, usually the lake of an extract from Buckthorn Berries with the but may have been used for other dyes based on Quercitron. The word pink came into use during the sixteenth century;
 According to the 2008 version of the Pigment Compendium, ""there is speculation that because of the yellow color, it is derived from the German ""pinkeln"" translated in a dictionary of 1798 (by Adelung and Schwann) as ‘to piss, to make water’."" (Reference Pigment Compendium, 2008, by Nicholas Eastaugh, Valentine Walsh, Tracey Chaplin and Ruth Siddall)
  
 ***Color depends on ripeness of the berries and precipitant; Deep yellow lake on alum and yellow brown on carbonates (Reference: A practical treatise on the manufacture of colors for painting, 1874, also see the Free Art Books page under Pigments, Art Conservation and Art Materials.)"

 If Indian yellow did come from cows urine, the common claim that they were cruelly ""force fed"" mango leaves is probably false. Mango Leaves are high in minerals, vitamins and protein and also anti-viral and antibacterial. Mango leaves may have been a perfect feed for cattle and not ""cruel"" at all (Ref: Feeding Value of Mango Leaf (Mangifera indica) for Growing Rabbits, Journal of Animal and Veterinary Advances, 2006, Vol: 5, Issue: 10, Page No.: 800-804),

 ""Mangos grow well in pastures, although cattle will graze off lower leaves.

(Ref p.16 under Silvopasture, of ""Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry: Mangifera indica (mango""),
