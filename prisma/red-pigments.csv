 † Fades, Darkens",T,IV,A,"Unique & beautiful hue, which is why many artists still use this fugitive pigment today. The natural form has an ancient history.
 It is not recommended for permanent work, and should only be used in books or illustrations that will be hidden from light. Despite it's low light fastness ratings, some old master's paintings have survived virtually unchanged, perhaps becuase it was used mostly as a glaze, mixed with resins. see below;
 ""Should only be used in oil color glazes and not mixed with white because of it's poor lightfastness in tints."" (Ref. The Artist's Handbook, By Ray Smith, DK Pub. 2003, p.22-23)
 PR 177, PR 179 or PR 264 are similar, and more permanent substitutes, but not identical.;
 Technically ""The colour index name ""PR83"" refers to the lake of the natural anthraquinone pigment, isolated from the madder root by Robiquet & Colin 1826; some manufacturers use the CI name ""PR83:1"" for the synthetic laked pigment invented by the German chemists Graebe and Lieberman in 1868"" (Ref. Handprint.com).
 My guess is that most companies and other resources are using the synthetic variety PR83:1 and just calling it PR83. 
 * Color depends on method of manufacture and the metal salt the Anthraquinone dye is fixed on. Tin salts giving more yellowish shades in artist pigments.
 Color depends on metal the lake is fixed on: 
 Aluminum = Red;
 Calcium = Bluish Red;

 There are many other names for ochres and red iron oxides, usually based on color hue (maroon, violet), production location (Turkey, Oxford), quarry, mining site or manufacturing method (burnt, fired, roasted) and to further complicate things they appear in amost all languages.
 They can be followed or prefixed by other properties such as raw, bright, deep, dark, medium, fine or transparent etc.
 There are also many different traditional spellings of the word Ochre, Ocher, Ocre, Oker, Oaker, etc. or Earth (Terra, Terre) and variances on the words oxide (Oxyde, oxid, etc.), Iron (di ferro, de fer, mars, Ferric, ferrous, etc.), red (rouge, rot, rosso, rojo, colorado, etc.) and brown (bruin, brun, marron, braun, moreno, etc.).
 The same names are now seemingly even used interchangeably for synthetic or natural forms, including some crossover with the names of yellow hydrated iron oxides (PY42, PY43) and brown iron oxides and umbers (PBr6, PBr7).
 The red iron oxide pigments have an ancient history and pigments often still use the traditional names not necessarily in the native tongue of the artists using them.

 (Ref: CAMEO Materials Database at Boston Museum of Fine Arts);
 ""Various impurities can accelerate blackening""
 ""Dry process Vermilion & Cinnabar are generally very pure, but can still exhibit some darkening"" 
 Darkening may be from contamination with Sodium Chloride (Salt) from an external source, possibly human skin debris. (Ref. Spring, M., Grout, R. 'The Blackening of Vermilion: An Analytical Study of the Process in Paintings'. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 23, pp 50–61 [PDF])
 Any darkening may be due to impurities (Ref: Journal of the Chemical Society, Vol. 13, 1875, p.673; Deterioration of the Colour of Vermilion by contact with Copper and Brass. By Karl Hummus);
 Vermilion has been commonly seen
 on Roman wall paintings, and on XV century Flemish paintings, still brilliant and quite unchanged.
 Darkening more often occurs when Vermilion is used in tempera or water color. 
 Impure and wet process vermillion is more likely to darken. (Ref:Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia, By Rutherford John Gettens, ©1942 , p.172);
  ""tests have shown that impurities in the alkali polysulfides used to make the pigment lead to this instability"" (Ref: Common Medieval Pigments by Amy Baker (2004); The Cochineal Repository , The University of Texas at Austin School of Information);
 (Ref: Natural Pigments Vermilion); 
 ""Darkening of Cinnabar based pigments occurs only in pigments containing traces of chlorine or exposed to the halogens. ""
 From Fields, ""blackening and fading in vermilion are always due to adulteration ‘by mixture with lake or carmine … or by red or orange lead’."" (Ref Pigment Compendium p.383); 
 ** Requires a PROP 65 Label, should not be used around children or any place children may have access to. Should wear a NIOSH certified dusk mask & gloves when working with the dry pigment powder. Do not smoke, eat or drink when working with this pigment or paints made with it.
 Probably not a big hazard to humans, as there is very little soluble mercury. (Ref: Natural Pigments, Vermilion & Cinnabar toxicology test results);"

 † Fades",S/O,II,A,"* ""PR 170 is in a family of red azo compounds, some may not be quite as light fast as others"" (Ref: PR 170 Handprint.com)
 ""The lightfastness and weatherfastness of Pigment PR170 varies, depending on the application and the crystaline form. The opaque form (F3RK) has very good lightfastness, and is more weather resistant. The transparent form (F5RK) has lightfastness that is considered acceptable in masstone applications, but it fades more in tints."" (Ref. Blick Art Materials PR-170)
 Chroma lists the artist grade Naphthol Crimson (PR170) in the Atelier line with a lightfastness of ASTM II , having a Blue Wool scale of 6 in masstone and 4-5 in tints, which would make it a marginal rating of II - at best. In the Jo Sonja line they state it as ASTM I (excellent). They also rate their student grade Cadmium Red Medium Hue (PR170) as ASTM I. Guerra paint & pigment clearly put their 'Naphthol Red Brilliant' (semi-opaque) as excellent to very good in all tints with a Blue Wool Scale rating of 7-8 in masstone and 6-7 in tints. Still yet, Guerra paint & pigment Naphthol Red Medium (semi-transparent) is rated with a blue wool scale of 6 in mass tone and 4-5 in tints. It seems that the more opaque versions of this pigment are more lightfast.
 Careful attention of brand specs should be made prior to any purchase, recommend making you own light fastness tests on the formulation you have."

 * lightfastness appears to vary considerably by manufacturer and brand; Bruce MacEvoy of Handprint rates the Daniel Smith watercolor very good, but he rates Old Holland watercolor very poorly, which is strange, because Old Holland is considered to be very high quality artist paints. 
 Most paint brands using this pigment label their tubes with excellent or very good lightfastness.
 Guerra Paint & Pigment rate their Anthraquinone Red pigment dispersion as excellent in all tints. Lansco (a pigment manufacturer) rates the light fastness as excellent in masstone, and good to very good in tints.
 It would be wise to make your own light fastness tests on the product you have. It appears that relying on the quailty of name brand paints may not be enough to ensure good results.

It is also used to replace the older naphthol reds, organic red pigments that are sometimes only marginally lightfast and weatherfast. (Ref. Blick Art Materials)
