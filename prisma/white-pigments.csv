 White Lead (Ref wikipedia);
 Stack or Dutch process lead white (Flake White) is made by taking strips or sheets of lead and rolling them up into porous clay pots where they are suspended above weak acetic acid (vinegar). The pots are then buried in fermenting horse dung or cow manure producing heat and CO2. The surface crust (flakes) are scraped off and then washed, dried & ground into a powder.
 Stack Process Lead White (Ref Natural Pigments);

 ""Lead carbonate is one of the compounds which can be named lead white. It is the synthetic analogue of the mineral cerussite"", ""Lead white usually refers to Lead Carbonate Hydroxide (Basic Lead Carbonate, Lead(II) carbonate basic or the natural form Hydrocerussite.
 In addition ‘lead white’ may be extended to describe the lead chloride oxides, lead phosphates and particularly the lead sulfates"" (Ref Pigment Compendium p.228, p.239)

 Many historical names referred to specific method or place of manufacture. Today these names are mostly just marketing terms, although some pigment suppliers have genuine Ceruse, and Flake white (dutch process) still available in small batches, most notably Natural Pigments, Kremer and Michael Harding to name a few. 
 Some Lead Whites are adulterated with Blanc Fix or Lithopone as extenders, adulterants and/ or to improve consistency. This would not usually be on the label or indicated in the literature. (Ref. THE ARTIST’S HANDBOOK by Pip Seymour)
 * all paints containing lead require a PROP 65 warning label in CA.
 Take precautions when working with lead paints. Lead is an accumulative poison and can build up in your body over years.
 Do not ingest, avoid skin contact.
 Lead has a sweet taste (it was even used as an artificial sweetener by the Romans), so keep it far out of the reach of children and pets.
 Do not inhale, wear a NIOSH certified dust mask when working with the dry pigment.
 It's a bad idea to ever spray paint or airbrush with lead based pigments. Even if you wear a dusk mask and protective clothing, it would be almost impossible to control and clean up the overspray."

 Synthetic Barium Sulfate:
  used as a white pigment, more often as as an extender or adulterant.
 The natural mineral baryte is roasted with coal, burning off the carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The product is then dissolved in water and filtered. The pure barium sulfate can then be precipitated out with sodium sulfate. (Ref Pigment Compendium, by Nicholas Eastaugh, Valentine Walsh, Tracey Chaplin and Ruth Siddall, Copyright © 2008, p.44-45);

 *** Oil absorption depends on particle size
 One of the most common metallic bases for precipitating dyes to make lake pigments (Ref).
 Often used as a filler, extender and adulterant to increase volume of a paint or pigment. Used this way it lowers the tinting strength of the mixed pigment. In the case of very strong colors like the Phthalo's it is not considered an adulterant, it is also added in small amounts to improve paint handling. 
 Very often it is used to greatly extend pigments in cheaper paints and pigments where it is considered an adulterant. Overuse may cause some yellowing and darkening in oil paints. (Ref The Artist's Handbook by Pip Seymour); (Ref The Artist's Handbook by Ralph Mayer)"
